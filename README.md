# Protocols (Beta Channel) [beta.labbench.io]

This repository contains protocols that are intended for testing Beta versions of LabBench. Beta versions of LabBench are versions of LabBench that are not yet officially released but are being tested by research groups collaborating with Inventors' Way as part of the LabBench Beta Program. The purpose of the LabBench Beta Program is a collaboration between researchers at academic institutions and the developers of LabBench that aims to create novel and open methods and devices for neuroscience research.

Currently, the following laboratories and sites participate in the LabBench Beta Program:

| Site  | Principal Investigator  | Area         |
|-------|----------|----|
| [Integrative Neuroscience Research Group, Department of Health Science and Technology, Aalborg University](https://vbn.aau.dk/en/organisations/integrative-neuroscience) | [Carsten D. Mørch]() | Research into the neuroscience of pain that aims at understanding the basic mechanisms of the pain system. Development of methods to investigate how nociceptors generate and mediate pain signals in healthy humans and pathological situations. **Beta Program focus: Development of functionality in LabBench for Perception Threshold Tracking.**
| [Steno Diabetes Center Nordjylland](https://stenodiabetescenter.rn.dk/Forskning/Forskningsprojekter-i-SDCN/MEDON) | [Johan Røikjer]() | Development of Perception Threshold Tracking for early detection of diabetic polyneuropathy. **Beta Program focus: Development of functionality in LabBench for Perception Threshold Tracking.** |
| [Laboratory ]() | [Laura Petrini](https://vbn.aau.dk/da/persons/112436)|
| [Saba]() | [Sabata Gervasio]() |

If LabBench does not adequately support your research and you would like to see that change, then write to (help@labbench.io) to become a member of this Beta program. By participating in this program, you will gain access to versions of LabBench before they become generally available, have its development tailored to fit your exact research needs, and have access to extensive support in running your experiments.
